  The interface is designed with using QML, MAVLink and Pyside. The project goal is getting live parameters from drone. The folder include one python file which make sense drone parameters from MAVLink. In python file drone parameters send to qml files with Signal&Slot system. 
The Code provides these parameters information : 
1) Altitude
2) Ground Speed
3) Vertical Speed
4) Yaw - Compass
5) Pitch - skyline
6) Roll
7) Mode
8) Arm & Disarm
9) Battery and GPS
10) Map

  The map system is showing drone snap locaiton and providing put waypoint marker. 
  Note : The project is not finished. I can put a marker but do not save. And I designed all parameters but now execute altitude and Yaw parameters.
